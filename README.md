As you can see above that I set out to do the website in a certain way, but as things developed I changed the content display around some. Thanks to Balsamiq for starting me with an end view in mind.

- Typography

The two font-families I used for my website are 'Merriweather' and 'Open Sans'. These two compliment each other well. Thanks to Google Fonts I found this match.


### Media

My project's church logo came from Canva, where I could personalise an image I found.

- YouTube

The two videos are credited from YouTube. I do not own the rights to any.

The rest of the images found on my website are credited to Shutterstock's fine resolution.
